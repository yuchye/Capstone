SMOTE uses a nearest neighbors algorithm to generate new and synthetic data we can use for training our model. We generate new samples **only in the training set** to ensure our model generalises well to unseen data. Instead of oversampling all minority classes, we instead oversample only the 3 most infrequent classes ('3', '9' and '8') such that we have 100 data points for each of these specific minority classes, which is an arbitarily small number we have chosen. Our previous attempts to oversample **all** minority classes led to an over-expansion of the y_train dataset which in turn led to unmanageable execution times when performing the subsequent modelling."
