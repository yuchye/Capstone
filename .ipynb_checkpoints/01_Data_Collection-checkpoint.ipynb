    "I will build and train a classifier to propose the correct classification of genetic variations based on an expert-annotated knowledge base of cancer mutation annotations and related biomedical terms, so that clinical pathologists can spend less effort manually reviewing medical literature to make the classification. The model performance will be guided by the best accuracy and AUC scores, and the model should improve upon the baseline by at least 10% - the baseline being defined as the proportion of each variant class in the given training set."
